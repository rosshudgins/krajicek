John is a singer-songwriter, visual artist, and performer.

One thing the COVID pandemic has shown us all is how much we cherish and miss live music. John loves to play live, loves interacting with audiences, and he is thrilled to be booking gigs again.

We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and like all singer-songwriters, John is heavily influenced by a variety of artists, beginning in his youth with The Beatles and Bob Dylan. Through the years, his influences have also included bands and songwriters such as REM, Tom Petty, Uncle Tupelo, Townes Van Zandt, Leonard Cohen, Wilco, Joni Mitchell, Johnny Cash, Will Johnson, and Centro-matic.

John's motto is "always be creating", and he is constantly (maybe obsessively) writing new songs. He knows that melody is king in this process, but he is equally fascinated by language, by the way we can process emotions, memories, and experiences into words. A lot of what John writes involves family and friends. Actual, real experiences, both profound moments and the more mundane moments that somehow become strong memories.
