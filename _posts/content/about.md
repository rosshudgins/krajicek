John Krajicek is a singer-songwriter, performer, visual artist, and host of the video podcast Time to Connect (YouTube channel).

We don't hear the word *eclectic* much these days. Maybe that's because everything seems to run together now. Maybe genres and labels are boxes we don't have as much use for. But *eclectic* is still a good word, and it definitely applies to Krajicek. Beginning in his youth with Dylan and Lennon obsessions, over the years he's stood on the shoulders of The Byrds, John Prine, REM, Townes VZ, Jeff Tweedy, Will Johnson, and a slew of people and friends you've never heard of.

Jï»¿ohn keeps telling himself to "always be creating," and he constantly writes songs, turning emotions, experiences, and memories into words, images, and melodies.
