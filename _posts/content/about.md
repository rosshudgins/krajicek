W﻿hat to say, what to say? There seems to be some contradiction between art and self-promotion. Between wanting to be seen & heard and wanting to be authentic. Between wanting to present yourself to the world accurately and all too common practices such as talking about yourself in third-person. Look, I make songs and I sing them. Jeff Tweedy once said something to the effect of pretty much anyone who gets up on stage is saying "please love me." I don't know about that, but I do know I like it when people like my songs.

B﻿ob Dylan has meant a lot to me, and these words from him pretty much sum it up: "Life isn't about finding yourself; or finding anything. Life is about creating yourself; and creating things."

I obsessively create. And I like to share. So here's my website. Take a look around.
